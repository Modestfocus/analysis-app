Transform the orange-circled menu area into an expandable/collapsible menu system (accordion style) as shown in the hand-drawn wireframe (second screenshot).

üèó Implementation Instructions:

1. Main Menu Items (Accordion Headers)
	‚Ä¢	Replace the current static menu section with an accordion menu component.
	‚Ä¢	Main Menu Items (Accordion Headers):
	‚Ä¢	Charts Dashboard (current default dashboard)
	‚Ä¢	Docs
	‚Ä¢	Notes
	‚Ä¢	Rules
	‚Ä¢	System Prompt
	‚Ä¢	Each of these headers should have a click-to-toggle expand/collapse function.
	‚Ä¢	Use smooth transitions for expand/collapse animation.
	‚Ä¢	Add a small arrow icon that rotates when expanding/collapsing.

‚∏ª

2. Nested Sub-Menus (Content Sections)
	‚Ä¢	When a Main Menu Item is expanded, display its corresponding sub-content section directly below it.
	‚Ä¢	For now, just show a placeholder clean page under each section (blank canvas with a title like ‚ÄúDocs Page‚Äù etc.).
	‚Ä¢	The Charts Dashboard will display the current chart cards as it does now.
	‚Ä¢	Docs, Notes, Rules, and System Prompt will display empty states until content is added.

‚∏ª

3. Behavioral Rules:
	‚Ä¢	Only one Main Menu section can be expanded at a time.
	‚Ä¢	Expanding a new section automatically collapses the previously opened section.
	‚Ä¢	Default state on page load: Charts Dashboard expanded.
	‚Ä¢	Clicking on an already expanded section collapses it back down.
	‚Ä¢	This should feel like a smooth accordion toggle experience.

4. Styling Instructions:
	‚Ä¢	Keep the design clean and aligned with the current platform‚Äôs styling (white background, soft borders, modern UI).
	‚Ä¢	Main Menu headers should have:
	‚Ä¢	Slight background shade on hover.
	‚Ä¢	Bold label (e.g., ‚ÄúDocs‚Äù, ‚ÄúRules‚Äù).
	‚Ä¢	A chevron icon (arrow) that rotates on toggle.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure the menu width aligns perfectly with the current layout ‚Äî do not shift the dashboard‚Äôs card layout structure.
	‚Ä¢	When a section is expanded, the content below should feel like it‚Äôs part of the same page (no page reload).

‚∏ª

5. Keep Existing Components Intact:
	‚Ä¢	Do not touch the existing Chart Cards, GPT-4o Analysis Panel, or Top Nav Tabs.
	‚Ä¢	This change applies only to the orange-circled menu area to introduce collapsible sections.

‚úÖ Deliverable:
	‚Ä¢	Fully functional Expandable Accordion Menu Navigation with sections:
	‚Ä¢	Charts Dashboard (default open)
	‚Ä¢	Docs
	‚Ä¢	Notes
	‚Ä¢	Rules
	‚Ä¢	System Prompt
	‚Ä¢	Clicking each toggles an expanded content area directly below.
	‚Ä¢	Clean, modern UI transitions with arrow animations.
