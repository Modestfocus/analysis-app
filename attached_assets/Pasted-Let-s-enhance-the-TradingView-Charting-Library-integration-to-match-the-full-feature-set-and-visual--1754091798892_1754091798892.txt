Let’s enhance the TradingView Charting Library integration to match the full feature set and visual layout of the native TradingView platform. Here’s what we need to implement next:

1. Left-Hand Tooling Sidebar (Drawing Panel)
	•	Add the full Drawing Toolbar (like TradingView’s left vertical panel).
	•	Should include:
	•	Trend Line, Horizontal Line, Ray, Parallel Channel
	•	Brush, Rectangle, Ellipse, Text, Arrow, etc.
	•	Ability to click on these tools and draw directly on the chart.
	•	Provide style options (color picker, thickness, line style) after selecting the drawn element.
	•	Ensure this toolbar is always visible and collapsible.

2. Right-Hand Symbol & Details Panel (Like TradingView’s Watchlist Pane)
	•	Keep the current Watchlist Panel but add:
	•	Symbol Info (like ticker details, % change)
	•	Ability to search and add symbols to watchlist.
	•	Option to display symbol details / price box similar to TradingView’s top left price section.

3. Drawing & Annotation Settings
	•	After drawing a line or shape, a context menu or side panel should appear allowing:
	•	Change color
	•	Adjust line thickness and style (solid, dashed, dotted)
	•	Lock or hide elements.
	•	Delete individual drawings.
	•	Default drawing settings should be saved to the user’s profile.

4. Chart Layout Save/Load Enhancement
	•	Ensure that when a user:
	•	Applies indicators
	•	Draws lines/annotations
	•	Adjusts colors/styles
	•	Zooms/pans the chart
	•	All these settings are saved as a layout profile tied to their account and auto-loaded when they return.

5. Optional: Trading Panel (Bottom)
	•	If possible, add a Trading Panel at the bottom, even if it’s mock data for now.
	•	Could show simulated Positions, Orders, PnL, just for practice visualization.
	•	We can later integrate live data.

Let’s prioritize Tooling Panel (Drawing Sidebar) and Drawing Customization first.

Once we get the Tooling Panel working, we can move on to Watchlist enhancements and Layout Save/Load polish.
