# Chart Analysis Application

## Overview
This full-stack application provides AI-powered analysis of trading charts. Users can upload multiple chart images, which are then automatically analyzed using advanced AI models like GPT-4o. Key capabilities include generating depth, edge, and gradient maps, finding similar charts via CLIP vector embeddings, and supporting multi-timeframe analysis bundles. The project aims to provide comprehensive technical insights and pattern recognition for trading charts, enhancing a user's analytical capabilities in financial markets.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Trading panel: Minimized by default for optimal chart viewing.
Dashboard default view: Condensed accordion layout with all sections closed by default.
System Prompt Interface: Three-view toggle interface (Inject, Current Prompt, Default Prompt) with dynamic AI integration.
Theme Preferences: Dark mode toggle implemented across all pages with automatic system preference detection and localStorage persistence.

## Recent Changes (August 2025)
### Chart Similarity Search Pipeline - COMPLETED âœ…
**Issue**: The `/chat/analyze` endpoint's `similarCharts` was always returning empty arrays despite having 119 charts in database.

**Root Cause Identified**: Charts existed in database but had no embeddings stored (0 out of 119 charts had embeddings).

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Database Schema**: Updated to use `vector(512)` column type with pgvector extension
2. **Embedding Service**: Configured CLIP (Transformers.js) model producing reliable 512-dimensional embeddings  
3. **Backfill Process**: Successfully generated embeddings for all 119 charts in database
4. **Storage Integration**: Fixed pgvector data format and similarity search queries
5. **Pipeline Integration**: Updated chat-analysis service to use functional embedding generation

**Result**: Similarity search now returns relevant charts with meaningful similarity scores (87-100% similarity for related charts). The `/chat/analyze` endpoint `similarCharts` field now populates correctly for RAG-enhanced analysis.
