Rebuild the Chart Panel UI layout and style to match the TradingView interface (second screenshot) as close as possible.

‚∏ª

üèó Specific Instructions:

1. Toolbar Layout (Top Section)
	‚Ä¢	Move Symbol Selector (US30 dropdown) to the left-most position, styled with TradingView‚Äôs search bar look.
	‚Ä¢	Price display (current price, % change) should be placed right next to the Symbol Selector ‚Äî styled as clean, white text with smaller % change in green/red.
	‚Ä¢	Timeframe buttons (5s, 30s, 1m, etc.) should be arranged horizontally, aligned to the center, in flat button style (white background, light gray border).
	‚Ä¢	Move Indicators button group (EMA 20, EMA 50, etc.) to a small indicators dropdown or side menu toggle (icon button), not directly on top of the chart.

‚∏ª

2. Chart Area Styling (Candlesticks Panel)
	‚Ä¢	Ensure:
	‚Ä¢	Candlesticks are thinner with smaller wicks ‚Äî similar to TradingView.
	‚Ä¢	Add grid lines (light gray, faint).
	‚Ä¢	Add crosshair cursor that snaps to data points.
	‚Ä¢	Enable hover tooltip with OHLC info on mouse hover.
	‚Ä¢	Add volume bars below candlesticks (optional for now).
	‚Ä¢	Ensure chart area has rounded top corners (light box shadow if possible).

‚∏ª

3. Watchlist Sidebar (Right Side)
	‚Ä¢	Align Watchlist vertically.
	‚Ä¢	Each symbol row should have:
	‚Ä¢	Symbol Name (Bold)
	‚Ä¢	Last Price (regular font)
	‚Ä¢	% Change (green/red pill badge)
	‚Ä¢	Highlight active symbol row with a colored background (light blue for US30 selection)
	‚Ä¢	Ensure Watchlist width is slightly narrower and visually grouped tight like TradingView‚Äôs right panel.
	‚Ä¢	Add a ‚Äù+‚Äù button at the top to simulate adding symbols.

‚∏ª

4. Overall Layout Adjustments
	‚Ä¢	Make sure the top toolbar and the chart canvas are in a fixed vertical alignment, just like TradingView.
	‚Ä¢	Shrink overall padding/margins to create a dense, trading-dashboard feel.
	‚Ä¢	Watchlist sidebar should be tight to the right edge, no gaps.
	‚Ä¢	Add a small settings icon near the top-right of the chart area to simulate indicator settings.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure everything is responsive and scales well on different screen sizes.

‚∏ª

5. Do Not Touch:
	‚Ä¢	Leave the ‚ÄúTake Screenshot‚Äù button where it is.
	‚Ä¢	Leave the Trading Panel (bottom section) untouched.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Final Deliverable (Frontend):
	‚Ä¢	Replicate TradingView‚Äôs visual layout proportions, button placements, and chart aesthetics.
	‚Ä¢	This is just UI styling & layout refinement ‚Äî no backend logic is required at this step.
	‚Ä¢	The goal is to make the Chart Panel look nearly identical to TradingView.
